      <p>I&rsquo;m a product designer based in Minneapolis, Minnesota currently focused on creating an accessible and inclusive design system at Realtor.</p>

      <p>As a designer, I seek to understand and meet users' needs through research and testing, and by holding my work to the highest standards of usability, accessibility, and delight. I have an abiding passion for systems-thinking, thoughtful critique, and delivering user-centered experiences that solve real-world challenges.</p>

      <p>Away from work, you&rsquo;ll find me slow-fermenting bread dough, photographing cool signage, rock climbing, and enjoying art around town.</p>
